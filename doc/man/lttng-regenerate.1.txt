NAME
----
lttng-regenerate - Manage an LTTng tracing session's data regeneration


SYNOPSIS
--------
Regenerate the metadata of a session

[verse]
*lttng* ['linkgenoptions:(GENERAL OPTIONS)'] *regenerate metadata* [option:--session='SESSION']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `lttng regenerate` command manages a tracing session's data regeneration
options.

As of this version, only the `metadata` command's action is available.
Regenerating a tracing session's metadata can be used to
resample the offset between the system's monotonic clock and
the wall-clock time.

This command is meant to be used to resample the wall-clock time
following a major
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol[NTP]
correction. As such, a system booting with an incorrect wall time can be
traced before its wall time is NTP-corrected. Regenerating the tracing
session's metadata ensures that trace viewers can accurately determine
the events time relative to Unix Epoch.

LIMITATIONS
-----------
The `lttng regenerate metadata` command can only be used on kernel and
user space tracing sessions (using per-user buffering), in non-live
mode.

See man:lttng-enable-channel(1) for more information about
buffering schemes and man:lttng-create(1) for more information
about the different tracing session modes.
